Class 1: RHPDS Lab - NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller For OpenShift
======================================================================

This class has one module and two labs. We're simply doing this to show the
standard structure of a class/module/lab.

.. note:: It could be simplier to throw all the content in one file but that
   would miss the point of showing how we curently use RST.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
